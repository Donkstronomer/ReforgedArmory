# WrathArmory for ElvUI (ElvUI Plugin)

**Do you wish you could display item level, enchants, gems on the character and inspect frame and have your options easily accessible in the ElvUI config?**  

### With this plugin, you are now able to do so. More options are coming, this is just a quick release to get it out there, so please be patient while I do work 2 jobs and do this in my spare time.
