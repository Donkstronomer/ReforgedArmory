# CataArmory (ElvUI Plugin)

**Do you wish you could display item level, enchants, gems on the character and inspect frame and have your options easily accessible in the ElvUI config?** Â 

### With this plugin, you are now able to do so. As this has most of the "must have" options, I am going to add and tweak some options here and there to get more advanced setups... so stay tuned!

*Note: Ensure you have ElvUI installed for functionality.*

Download now and get what you deserve!
