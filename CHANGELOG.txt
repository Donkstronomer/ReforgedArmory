• Reorganized the project files a little more!!! Delete the old ElvUI_WrathArmory folder and replace... do not override!!!

    (If missing enchants, missing belt buckle, and having empty sockets, the warning bar will display to indicate a possible issue, which you can mouse over and see the warning text of the possible issue)
• LibGetEnchant update & clean up some enchants to be shorter
• update codebase to reflect ElvUI changes
